# Temperature-Prediction
Predicting Temperature for a particular location using Latitude and Longitude

*The longitudes' and latitudes' coordinates are used for predicting the Temperature of the particular region*

Plotted below is to the major portion of the coordinates lying in.

The dataset is divided into two parts training and testing where the Train dataset is 85%.

Further KNN algorithm is applied on the tarining dataset for creating a predictive model and later the test dataset is passed.
